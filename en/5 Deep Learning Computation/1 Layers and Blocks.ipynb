    "# Layers and Blocks\n",
    "\n",
    "While you might think that neurons, layers, and models\n",
    "give us enough abstractions to go about our business,\n",
    "it turns out that we often find it convenient\n",
    "to speak about components that are\n",
    "larger than an individual layer\n",
    "but smaller than the entire model.\n",
    "For example, the ResNet-152 architecture,\n",
    "which is wildly popular in computer vision,\n",
    "possesses hundreds of layers.\n",
    "These layers consist of repeating patterns of *groups of layers*.\n",
    "Similar architectures in which layers are arranged in various repeating patterns are now ubiquitous in other domains, including natural language processing and speech.\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement these complex networks,\n",
    "we introduce the concept of a neural network *block*.\n",
    "A block could describe a single layer,\n",
    "a component consisting of multiple layers,\n",
    "or the entire model itself!\n",
    "\n",
    "![](../img/blocks.svg) Multiple layers are combined into blocks, forming repeating patterns of larger models.\n",
    "\n",
    "From a programing standpoint, a block is represented by a *class*.\n",
    "Any subclass of it must define a forward propagation function\n",
    "that transforms its input into output\n",
    "and must store any necessary parameters.\n",
    "Finally a block must possess a backpropagation function,\n",
    "for purposes of calculating gradients.\n",
    "Fortunately, due to some behind-the-scenes magic\n",
    "supplied by the auto differentiation\n",
    "when defining our own block,\n",
    "we only need to worry about parameters\n",
    "and the forward propagation function.\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin, we revisit the code\n",
    "that we used to implement MLPs.\n",
    "The following code generates a network\n",
    "with one fully-connected hidden layer\n",
    "with 256 units and ReLU activation,\n",
    "followed by a fully-connected output layer\n",
    "with 10 units (no activation function)."

For example, the first fully-connected layer in our model above ingests an      input of arbitrary dimension but returns an output of dimension 256.\n",
    "1. Calculate the gradient of its output with respect to its input, which can be accessed via its backpropagation function. Typically this happens automatically.\n",
